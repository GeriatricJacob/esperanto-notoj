Some notes on Esperanto gathered from various corners of the internet.
## Alphabet
The Esperanto alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet, it includes all 26 bar Q, W, X and Y. It also includes ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ , ŝ and ŭ.
### Pronunciation
Each letter has a unique and separate sound. For example: _longa_ is pronounced "lon-ga". Both _k_ and _n_ are pronounced in _knabo_.

Here are approximate English vowel equivalents:

Esperanto | English Equivalent
--- | ---
a | ah
e | eh
i | ee
o | oh
u | oo
ŭ | w (as in wet)

Consonants:

Esperanto | English Equivalent
--- | ---
b | b (as in bib)
c | ts (as in pets)
ĉ | ch (as in chair)
d | d (as in deed)
f | f (as in fast)
g | g (as in gag)

## Grammar
### Adjectives
Adjectives are words like fast, good, or big, which modify a noun. Remember that a noun always ends in -o in Esperanto. Adjectives, on the other hand, end in -a:

rapida = fast, granda = big, bona = good

In Esperanto, the adjective may be placed either before or after the noun with no change in meaning. "Bona viro" and "viro bona" both mean "a good man" and both are correct. In practice, most people place the adjective before the noun.

### Adverbs
Adverbs (usually -ly words in English) modify verbs and adjectives. In Esperanto they almost always end in -e. Examples:

rapide = quickly, malrapide = slowly, bone = well

### Building Words
Words in Esperanto consist of roots, which carry the meaning, and the part-of-speech ending, which indicates the function of the word in the sentence. However, most Esperanto roots exhibit an inherent part of speech; that is, most roots are inherently nouns, verbs or adjectives. Bearing this point in mind makes Esperanto word-building easier to understand.
In Esperanto, all singular nouns end in "o," regardless of gender, and all plural nouns end in "oj." Nouns are turned feminine by the insertion of "in" between the word root and the "o" or "oj" suffix. For example:

-   Hundo (dog)
-   Hundoj (dogs)
-   Hundino (she-dog)
-   Hundinoj (she-dogs)

## Affixes
`mal-` is a prefix that means "the opposite of", e.g. `malbona` meaning `bad` from `bona` meaning `good`

`-ej` is a suffix used to indicate a place, e.g. `kafejo` meaning `café` from `kafo` meaning `coffee`

`-ebl-` is a a suffix meaning "possible" like -able in English e.g. `kredebla` meaning believable from `kredi` meaning believe, may also be used standalone as `eble` meaning `possibly`

`mis-` is a prefix meaning "awry" e.g. `misloki` meaning `to misplace` from `loki` meaning `place`

These are but a few common of the many affixes in Esperanto, many more can be found [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Esperanto/Appendix/Table_of_affixes).

### Word Building With Affixes
#### Suffix
Simply place the suffix between the word root and ending.
####  Prefix
Simply place the prefix before the word.

## Questions
A simple yes or no questions can be created by placing Ĉu at the beginning of a statement. e.g. `Li estas malbela` means `He is ugly`  adding Ĉu `Ĉu li estas malbela`  means `Is he ugly?`
-   kiu - _who_ or _which_
-   kio - _what_
-   kia - _what kind of_
-   kie - _where_
-   kiam - _when_
-   kies - _whose_
-   kiel - _how_
-   kial - _why_
-   kiom - _how much_ or _how many_


## Pronouns
To make a pronoun possessive in Esperanto we simply add "a" to the end.
English pronoun | English possessive | Esperanto pronoun | Esperanto possesive
--- | --- | --- | ---
i | my | mi | mia
you | your | vi | via
he | his | li | lia
she | her | ŝi | ŝia
it | its | ĝi | ĝia
we | our | ni | nia
they | their | ili | ilia

## The accusative ending: -n
Take a look at this English sentence: "The woman kisses the little boy." How do you know who is kissing, and who is being kissed? In English, you know by the word order. The woman comes before the verb, so she is doing the kissing (or to use the grammatical term, she is the subject of the sentence). The little boy comes after the verb, so he's the one being kissed (and he is the grammatical object of the sentence).  
In Esperanto, you can tell who is the subject and who is the object of the sentence by the endings. The **subject** of the sentence, i.e. the one who is doing the kissing, ends in **_-o_** . The **object** of the sentence, the one who is being kissed, has **_-n_** added after the **_-o_** . This means that you can always tell who or what is the subject, and who or what is the object, even if the sentence is switched around:  

_La virino kisas la malgrandan knabon._  
The woman kisses the little boy.  

_La malgrandan knabon kisas la virino._  
The woman kisses the little boy.  
(Look for the _-n_ ! This still means "The woman kisses the little boy", even though the word order has been changed.)

Note that the adjective (in this case _malgranda_) also takes the _-n_ ending, the same as the noun it refers to: _malgranda**n** knabo**n**_ .  

These sentences mean the same thing, and are all equally correct. They **all** mean: "The woman kisses the small boy.":  
_La virino kisas la malgrandan knabo**n**._  
_La malgrand**an** knabo**n** kisas la virino._  
_Kisas la virino la malgranda**n** knabo**n**._  
_Kisas la malgranda**n** knabo**n** la virino._  
_La virino la malgranda**n** knabo**n** kisas._  
_La malgranda**n** knabo**n** la virino kisas._  

The _-n_ ending in Esperanto is called the accusative. Be aware that the accusative ending _-n_ is never used with the verb _estas_: _Li estas knabo._ (He is a boy.)

### Accusative and Plural

If a word already ends in _-j_, the _-n_ is added after it.

_Mi manĝas bona**jn** kuko**jn**._  
I am eating good cakes.  
_Mi vidas la bela**jn** virino**jn**._  
I see the beautiful women.
